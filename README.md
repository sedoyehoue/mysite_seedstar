Django App
Make an application which stores names and email addresses in a database (SQLite is fine). Make sure it:
Has welcome page in http://localhost/
Note: this page has links to list and create functions
Lists all stored names/email address in http://localhost/list
Adds a name/email address to the database in http://localhost/add Note: should validate input and show errors
The challenge is a Django based application, so please make sure you use all of Django infrastructure (form, template inheritance, ORM) correctly. Also make sure the app does not have major security problems: CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection.
